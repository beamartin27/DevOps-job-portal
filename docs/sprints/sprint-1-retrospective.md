# Sprint 1 Retrospective

**Sprint Duration**: November 21 – November 26  
**Sprint Goal**: Establish initial infrastructure, backend foundation, architecture outline, and Scrum structure

---

## What Went Well ✅

- Successfully set up Azure App Service Plan and backend App Service
- Completed first manual backend deployment to Azure
- Documented Scrum roles and initial Definition of Done early
- Backend health-check tests confirmed initial scaffolding worked
- Positive team communication and proactive collaboration

## What Didn't Go Well ❌

- Many tasks marked "Done" but not production-ready:
  - Azure architecture lacked detail for CI/CD and monitoring
  - Environment variables configured but not fully validated
  - Backend contract check done at high level, not confirmed with frontend
- Underestimated time needed to understand Azure services
- Manual deployment only - no automated pipeline or repeatable process
- Unclear task implementation steps from backlog
- Inconsistent coordination between backend and frontend on API structure

## What We Learned 💡

- Azure setup takes longer than expected - deployment assumptions were too optimistic
- Tasks need detailed acceptance criteria to avoid ambiguous work
- Documentation must evolve alongside development, not afterward
- Clearer handoffs needed between backend and frontend for API contracts
- CI/CD pipeline must start earlier to avoid deployment stress

## Improvements Identified 🔧

- Write more detailed task descriptions and acceptance criteria
- Validate "Done" status strictly against Definition of Done
- Establish better frontend ↔ backend communication on API structure
- Start automation (pipelines) earlier instead of waiting
- Plan smaller, achievable tasks to ensure real completeness

## Team Agreements for Next Sprint 🤝

- Do not mark tasks Done unless they fully satisfy DoD and work in Azure
- Introduce short internal reviews before closing tasks
- Frontend ↔ Backend joint contract check early in sprint
- Update architecture document incrementally
- Begin CI/CD setup with clear ownership assigned
