# Sprint 4 Retrospective

**Sprint Duration**: December 9 – December 13  
**Sprint Goal**: Finalize documentation and Scrum evidence, complete testing, polish UX, refactor backend, and prepare final demo

---

## What Went Well ✅

- Frontend UX polishing completed early, significantly improving user experience for demo
- Backend cleanup and refactoring successfully completed, reducing technical debt
- Infrastructure cleanup (tags, Azure organization) improved deployment environment consistency
- Screenshots and deployment evidence collected and organized for final submission
- Team collaboration improved with focused discussions and clear awareness of deliverables

## What Didn't Go Well ❌

- Major documentation tasks (README, project summary, Scrum evidence) unfinished until sprint end
- Final testing and test reporting delayed - some tests manual rather than automated
- Pipeline didn't integrate test reports cleanly
- Demo script and story in progress near deadline, limiting practice time
- Architecture and deployment documentation from Sprint 3 needed significant revisions
- Time pressure increased with front-loaded tasks at sprint end
- CI/CD pipelines still had inconsistencies with environment variables and GitHub/Azure integration

## What We Learned 💡

- Documentation and testing must be ongoing tasks, not end-of-project activities
- Final sprint planning must include buffer time for unexpected issues
- Polished demo requires advance preparation - script and flow shouldn't be left to final days
- Cleanup tasks (tags, refactoring, screenshots, verification) more time-consuming than anticipated
- Stronger alignment between infra, backend, and documentation owners improves delivery quality

## Improvements Identified 🔧

- Begin documentation updates earlier so final sprint focuses on polishing
- Implement automated test execution earlier to avoid manual testing pressure
- Establish consistent folder structure for documentation and screenshots early
- Conduct internal demo rehearsals mid-sprint to catch issues before deadline
- Include explicit "finalization tasks" in sprint planning

## Team Agreements for Future Projects 🤝

- Maintain documentation throughout project lifecycle
- Integrate monitoring, testing, and deployment verification early
- Adopt stricter Definition of Done for CI/CD, testing, and documentation
- Schedule internal demo reviews before final sprint
- Ensure clear ownership for documentation, pipelines, and demo materials
