# Sprint 1 Review

**Dates:** Nov 21 – Nov 26  
**Sprint Goal:** Establish foundational Azure infrastructure and initial backend service.

## Completed Work
- Backend App Service created and deployed manually for the first time.
- App Service Plan provisioned for backend compute.
- Backend health-check endpoint working in Azure.
- Initial Scrum documentation created (roles, DoD).
- High-level Azure architecture drafted (services, CI/CD outline).
- Backend environment variables configured.
- Local sanity check of backend passed.

## Not Fully Completed / Gaps
- Architecture document lacked detail around monitoring and SQL.
- CI/CD pipeline remained only conceptual.
- Frontend/backed API contract was defined but not validated in practice.

## Stakeholder Feedback
- Positive progress on infrastructure.
- Requested clearer architecture diagrams.
- Highlighted need for CI/CD starting earlier.

## Agreements for Next Sprint
- Begin CI/CD implementation.
- Strengthen architecture documentation.
- Validate API contract through real integration early in Sprint 2.
